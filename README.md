# Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

[Most recent completed project](https://github.com/NIGHTF1RE/Portfolio/tree/main/One-Shot%20Notebooks/Hotel%20Cancellations) and associated [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19-8qKiQA4yhinbKLD3q16CXiZxnUNtlEm61ytuVKvPw/edit#slide=id.p)

Here, you will find a collection of my projects and contributions, showcasing my skills and passion for data science and anlystics. Many parts of the portfolio demonstrate final products, unless of course I am currently working on something. Others, however, may simply be me learning certain techniques and frameworks. I specify which is which below. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!

## AI notice

In the interest of transparency, I want to be clear that I do use GitHub CoPilot when building some of these files. I believe that AI code generation (and text generation) is a highly useful accelerant on a wide variety of projects that helps to reduce the time spent on rote typing and increase time on . I do not, however, believe that AI is a replacement for human analysis or ingenuity, and I am quite aware that it is prone to mistakes. I check that generated code works as I expect prior to using it.

## Sub portfolios
My portfolio is broken up into a number of sub portfolios, each meant to demonstrate a cluster of skills or serve as a location for my contined learning and experimentation.

### One-Shot Notebooks
This is where my most complete, true portfolio style work is. There will never be more than one incomplete project here at a time.

### Clustering
This portfolio currently only consists of a single Python Python script based on textual clustering. It gets the job done, but is overall terribly inefficient in many ways. It also tries to cluster based on neural network embeddings, which causes a lot of problems related to the curese of dimensionality. I hope to spend some time updating this in the near future, both in the sense of improving the clustering in the file and adding new clustering techniques for both textual and non-textual data

### Generative AI
This currently just a collection of uitility functions useful in detecting plagiarism and repetitiveness in text. These were problems in earlier versions of GPT when used for certain applications. It is likely not as useful now, and I will update this with more useful demonstrations of Generative AI work soon.

### ModelTrainingAndTuning
An old piece of code that I wrote to continue the mask word training for a BERT model. Very interesting in to use to adapt BERT to domain specific knowledge before actual fine tuning.

### PySpark
Illustration of some basic techniques used for distributed data processing.
