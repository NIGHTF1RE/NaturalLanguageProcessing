The associated presentation for this work can be found (here)[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19-8qKiQA4yhinbKLD3q16CXiZxnUNtlEm61ytuVKvPw/edit#slide=id.g2e7b6a2bfbe_0_315]. This presentation is targeted at a general audience, although somebody with technical knowledge would need to be presenting. The slide deck is not meant to be a standalone document, and I would not expect somebody without a technical background to read it, and especially the second half, and fully understand the information. 

This project shows basic EDA techniques, model tuning techniques, and how we can use models with Monte Carlo simulation to make better predictions about aggregate behavior.
